Traverse through the string_data and record the occurence of each characters in the string. And, convert each string into the bindary format and then after completing, Again, Traverse through the data and change every char occurence with the encoded new string acc. to the tree.

Time complexity: O(nlogn)
Space complexity: O(distinct_characters)

Here, `n` is number of characters in the string.
