Created a set for the union and intersection of the two Linked List.
Then created a new LinkedList from the sets.

For the union, created only one set.
For the intersection, created two sets then intersect them with the help of intersection method.

Union: 
Time complexity: O(n) 
Space complexity: O(n)


Intersection: 
Time complexity: O(n) 
Space complexity: O(n)
