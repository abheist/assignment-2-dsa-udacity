Created a set for the union and intersection of the two Linked List.
Then created a new LinkedList from the sets.

For the union, created only one set.
For the intersection, created two sets then intersect them with the help of intersection method.

Union:
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

Intersection:
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

Here, `n` is number of elements in both the lists.
